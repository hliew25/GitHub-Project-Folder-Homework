This repository is based on the project structure as listed in the previous discussion. 
My data file is separated into raw and processed data folders.
The raw data folder includes:
- One text file that has information on the type of injections that were used at the site and how the type of injections are recorded
- Two other text files that has information on the two trial sites which included information on where, how long and what injections were 
used
- The two .dat files are raw data obtained from the sites that could possibly opened as .csv files

The processed data folder includes two additional folders of code and output.
The code folder would include script files that are statistical analysis done on the trial sites overall and individually
The output folder is separated in figures, tables and manuscript where the figures folder would include only plots that are generated from 
the analysis, the tables 
folder would include descriptive or statistical model analyses that extracted from the analyses performed, and the manuscript folder will 
include document folders 
of different sections of the manuscript (which in the future could be added upon based on abstract, introduction, method, results and 
discussion subsections) but 
for now only has the abstract file that will give a preliminary idea of what the paper will be about.
